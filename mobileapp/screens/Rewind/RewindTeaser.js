// Teaser / Splash Screen
// 	• As soon as the user taps “Rewind,” show a very brief fullscreen animation or graphic—maybe a vintage book gently opening (faded‐in GLSL shader + overlaid text: “Your Monthly Reading Rewind).
// 	• Have it auto‐fade out after 1–1.5 seconds (or let the user tap to skip), so it feels like a teaser, not a full step.
